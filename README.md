# Soleil-Levant

<Strong>Overview:</Strong>
<br />
After downloading Soleil Levant, you can ran it via Android Studio with either an emulator or your actual phone. 
With Soleil Levant, you would be able to experience impressionism. You can first upload images form your local drive to the left side of the screen or simply take a picture and use that. Then you can choose a brush type. The image on the left-side canvas would be reflected by each drawing on the right-side canvas. You can also upload different images but still draw on the same right-side canvas. If you'd like, you can save your art piece to your local drive.
